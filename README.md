"# Simple-Banking-System" 

Created a simple baking system using Java Swing that allows the creation of "people" and their respective bank accounts. These bank accounts are interactable through deposits, bills, passing time for interest effects, and transfers between different individuals or between different bank accounts belonging to the same person.
